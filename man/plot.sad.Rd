\description{
Plot species abundance distributions
}
\details{
With \code{method = "octave"} a histogram showing the number
species in several abundance classes is generated. The abundance class
are a simplified version of the "octaves" suggested by Preston (1948), which
are based on log2-binning. The first abundance class includes species
with 1 individual, the second with 2, the third with 3-4, the fourth with 5-8, etc.

With \code{method = "rank"} rank-abundance curve is generated with
species abundance rank on the x-axis (descending) and species abundance on
the y-axis (Hubbell 2001).

\examples{
abund1 <- sim_sad(s_pool = 100, n_sim = 10000, sad_type = "lnorm",
                  sad_coef = list("cv_abund" = 1))
plot(abund1, method = "octave")
plot(abund1, method = "rank")
