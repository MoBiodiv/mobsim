\title{Get local diversity indices}
\usage{
div_rect(x0, y0, xsize, ysize, comm)
}
\arguments{
\item{x0}{x-coordinate of lower left corner}

\item{y0}{y-coordinate of lower left corner}

\item{xsize}{Size of the subplot in x-direction}

\item{ysize}{Size of the subplot in y-direction}

\item{comm}{\code{\link{community}} object}
}
\value{
Named vector with six diversity indices
\enumerate{
\item n_species: Number of species
\item n_endemics: Number of endemics
\item shannon: Shannon index index defined as \eqn{H = - \sum p_i * log(p_i)},
where \eqn{p_i} is the relative abundance of species i:
\item ens_shannon: Effective number of species (ENS) based on the Shannon index exp(H)
\item simpson: Simpson index index (= probability of interspecific encounter PIE)
defined as \eqn{D =  1 - \sum p_i^2}
\item ens_simpson: Effective number of species (ENS) based on the Simpson index \eqn{1/D}

}
}
\description{
Get diversity indices including species richness, no. of endemics,
Shannon and Simpson diversity for one rectangle subplot in the community.
}
\details{
The effective number of species is defined as the number of equally
abundant species that produce the same value of a certain diversity index
as an observed community (Jost 2006). According to Chao et al. 2014 and
Chiu et al. 20 ENS_shannon
can be interpreted as the number of common species and ENS_simpson as the
number of dominant species in a community.
